sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or 
Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in 
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy 
   of this License; and

   2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
   You changed the files; and

   notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
   one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of 
   the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided 
   along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the 
   Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
   The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do 
   not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
   Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
   NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
   cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in 
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in 
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree 
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the 
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the 
best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public 
domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby 
dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship 
identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, 
dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and 
to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends 
this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all 
present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, 
in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights 
includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) 
those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be 
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or 
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or 
conceived.

Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification


The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the 
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the 
best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public 
domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby

identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, 
dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and

otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or

Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification


The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the 
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the 
best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public 
domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby 
dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship 
identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, 
dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and 
to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends 
this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all 
present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, 
in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights 
includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) 
those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be 
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or 
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or

dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and 
to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends 
this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all 
present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, 
in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights 
includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) 
those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be 
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or 
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or 
conceived.
